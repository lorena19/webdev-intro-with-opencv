"Computer Vision Web Development â€“ Introduction" on the Computer Vision.zone website is designed to teach how to integrate computer vision with web development. It's a beginner-friendly course, teaching you how to intergate opencv with web development, 
and focuses on using JavaScript. This is my first project getting some hands on experience and beginner friendly knowledge of opencv.
